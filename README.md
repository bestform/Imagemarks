Imagemarks
==========

A chrome extension, that shows ALL the image bookmarks as a list of images. Great for those huge animted gif collections. The extension let's you filter for titles and edit titles directly in the popup. Find the perfect i-know-i-had-it-bookmarked-somewhere-image instantly and post it wherever you like. It's that awesome.
